% Abstract
\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
In the contemporary landscape of higher education, student attrition remains a persistent and costly challenge for institutions worldwide. This project addresses the critical need for a proactive \textbf{Early Warning System (EWS)} capable of identifying students at high risk of dropout before they disengage. We propose a robust, end-to-end Machine Learning framework that leverages a diverse array of features—including demographic, socio-economic, and academic indicators—to predict student outcomes into three distinct classes: Dropout, Enrolled, and Graduate.

The methodology employs advanced ensemble learning techniques, specifically \textbf{Random Forest} and \textbf{XGBoost}, which are known for their ability to handle high-dimensional, non-linear data. To combat the pervasive issue of Class Imbalance, we integrate the \textbf{Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)}, ensuring the model is sensitive to the minority 'Dropout' class. Our optimized Random Forest model achieves a test accuracy of \textbf{77.3\%}, significantly outperforming baseline Logistic Regression models.

Furthermore, acknowledging that "black-box" predictions are insufficient for educational intervention, this system integrates \textbf{Explainable AI (XAI)} via \textbf{SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)}. This facilitates granular, instance-level explanations, empowering administrators to understand the specific factors driving each prediction (e.g., "Student X is at risk due to overdue tuition fees").

The system is deployed as a scalable web application using \textbf{FastAPI} for the backend and \textbf{React} for the frontend, featuring a dynamic schema-locking mechanism to ensure production reliability. This report details the complete lifecycle of the project, from mathematical formulation and algorithm design to implementation and performance analysis.
